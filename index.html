				Day 8: Minor Changes and a Reflection
			</h3>
			<p class="date">Aug 27</p>
			<p class="entry">
				It's been one week since I started this project. I'm a big believer in reflection to help reinforce lessons that have been learned. Comparing the first entry and layout with the current set leaves me with a satisfied feeling. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				Some of the most important things I've learned include:
				<ul class="entry">
					<li>Knowing the difference between Block and Inline elements and their intended purpose</li>
					<li>Paddings and Margins: these are some of the most important CSS attritubes in terms of positioning elements just the way you want</li>
					<li>Layouts: starting out with a fixed layout is fine, but isn't as flexible as a liquid layout. The later makes it easier to handle various browser window sizes, but make sure to set the min-width and max-width accordingly to ensure readability</li>
					<li>Viewports: relatively new measurement unit where 1vh = 1% of the browser height and 1vw = 1% of the browser width. Used this to create the welcome screen (provides the flexibility to adjust based on the browser window size)</li>
				</ul>
				<br/>	
				I think the next hurdle to climb would be getting a better grasp of JavaScript. I'll continue to document my progress on this page and see what kind of new features can be incorportated via Javascript. 
				<br/>
				<br/>
				<b>Changes:</b> 
				<ul class="entry">
					<li>Narrowed the upcoming column by a little bit, but kept the overall dimensions of the div close to the Golden ratio (just added a margin between the upcoming column and the entry one)</li>
				</ul>
				<b>Why?</b>
					<ul class="entry"> 
						<li>
							The previous layout was awkward with the amount of whitespace between the two columns, this one feels a bit better but like everything else on the page, it is subject to change
						</li>
					</ul>
			</p>

		<h4>Upcoming</h4>
			<ul class="entry">
				<li>Fix up the 2 column layouts: too much whitespace between columns</li>
				<li>Reflection on the first seven days of HTML and CSS</li>

				Day 7: Saying Goodbye to Logo v2
			</h3>
			<p class="date">Aug 26</p>
			<p class="entry">
				<b>Changes:</b> 
				<ul class="entry">
					<li>Removed the logo and header</li>
						<ul>
							<li>was able to implement the new welcome screen by making use of viewport units, specifically vw and vh</li>
							<li>the current implementation of getting the text to vertically center doesn't feel right. I created a div and set the display attribute to table-cell so that the vertical-align attribute would center the text (which is not its intended purpose). I'll keep it the way it is for now, but hopefully there is a better way</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Reworked the left column to be an upcoming/ to-do section </li>
				</ul>
				<b>Why?</b>
					<ul class="entry"> 
						<li>Trying out various kinds of layouts still, I think the page looks better without it</li>

			Day 1: Entry Structure

		<p>
			Starting today, I'll update the changes of only the latest post. As more and more posts get added, it's going to look a little strange, but hopefully it conveys that the entries keep getting better.

			Aug 20
			<br/>
			<b>Changes:</b> 
			<ul>
				<li>Learned to use the list tag</li>
				<li>Used a horizontal rule to separate each entry</li> 
				<li>Updated change list to bold the sections</li>
				<li>Learned to use the img tag</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Why?</b>
			<ul> 
				<li>Needed a way to clearly separate the entries and for now, the hr tag gets the job done</li>
				<li>Bolding each section of the change log was done to make to make it easier to separate the 
					topic and the answer</li>
				<li>I want to put some images up to make the page look nicer</li>
				<li>Started with a text logo exported as a JPG for a v1</li>

			Goal: getting comfortable with HTML/CSS 
		</p>
		<p>	
			I'm going to try and improve this page whenever I learn more about HTML and CSS. I'll try keep a format going, lets say something like this:
		</p>
		<p>
			Date: Aug 19<br>
			Changes: Outlined the goals of this project<br> 
			Why were these changes made: Needed a tangible project to learn about HTML/CSS, started with the basics of the head, body, br and p tags<br>
		</p>

		<p>This is a work in progress.</p>
