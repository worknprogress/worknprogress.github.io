			Day 10: Exercises from Program Structure 
		</h3>
		<p class="date">Aug 30</p>
		<p class="entry">
		I'm going to use <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/">Eloquent JavaScript</a> to get more comfortable with JavaScript. I'll be posting my solutions to the exercises for each chapter along with some lessons learned when I wasn't able to achieve the ideal solution. 
		<ul class="entry">
			<li>Looping a triangle</li> 
			<pre><code>for(var trig = '#'; trig.length < 8; trig = trig + '#')
  console.log(trig);</code></pre>
			<li>FizzBuzz</li> 
			<pre><code>for(var count = 1; count <= 100; count++){
 var out ="";
 if(count % 3 == 0)
   out +="Fizz";
 if(count % 5 == 0)
   out +="Buzz";
 console.log(out || count);
}
</code></pre>
		Lesson learned: The ideal approach is to let the output flow form each statement to statement, like what happens between case statements when there is no <code>break;</code> inbetween. This is in contrast to isolating each case(ie. if the input is divisible by 3 else if the input is divisible by 5 do this else if it is divible by 3 and 5 do this) which is not practical when there is a single output and the conditions to create it are not mutually exclusive
		<br/>
		<br/>
			<li>Chess board</li> 
			<pre><code>var size = 8;
var out = "";
for(var n = 1; n <= (size*size) + (size-1); n++){
  if(n % (size+1) == 0){
    out += "\n";
    continue;
  }
  if(n % 2 == 1)
    out += " ";
  else
    out += "#";
}
console.log(out);
</code></pre>
		Lesson learned: I'm a bit torn between the book's solution provided <a href="http://eloquentjavascript.net/code/#2.3">here</a> and the solution I presented above. From my understanding, a solution that works with one for loop has better performance than one that implements two. However, at first glance, the book's implementation gets the message across quicker. In the implementation I created, I realized that the output string length would be the size variable squared + an additional size-1 characters for the newline characters that are used for each row (it is size-1 because we don't want an additional newline on the last row). In the future, I'll be sure to look more closely at how the clarity of the code can be at times by traded off with performance.

			Day 9: Note on vertical alignment in a div
		</h3>
		<p class="date">Aug 28</p>
		<p class="entry">
		There are a few different solutions I tried when implementing the welcome screen and getting the text to center vertically and horizontally:
		<ul class="entry">
			<li> Absolute positioning with a combination of top, bottom, left and right attributes set to zero </li> 
				<ul>
					<li>Wasn't the best solution since I needed the div to be aware of the elements around it</li>
				</ul>
			<li> Setting the line-height </li>
				<ul>
					<li>Only good when the div size is known before hand, didn't fit with the goal of the page trying to be as fluid as possible </li>
				</ul>
			<li> Using relative positioning and transforms </li>
				<ul>
					<li>Not effective when the div takes up the screen</li>
				</ul>
			<li> Div with the display set to table-cell and using vertical align</li> 
				<ul>
					<li> As mentioned previously, the vertical-align attribute was not intended to vertically align text in block elements, but does so when the block element is a table. This was the best working solution for the welcome screen at this time</li>
				</ul>
		</ul>
		<br/>
		I'm interested to see what the finalized versions of Flexbox and Grid Layout look like and see if they can provide a better solution to the one in place

			Day 8: Minor Changes and a Reflection
		</h3>
		<p class="date">Aug 27</p>
		<p class="entry">
			It's been one week since I started this project. I'm a big believer in reflection to help reinforce lessons that have been learned. Comparing the first entry and layout with the current set leaves me with a satisfied feeling. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			Some of the most important things I've learned include:
			<ul class="entry">
				<li>Knowing the difference between Block and Inline elements and their intended purpose</li>
				<li>Paddings and Margins: these are some of the most important CSS attritubes in terms of positioning elements just the way you want</li>
				<li>Layouts: starting out with a fixed layout is fine, but isn't as flexible as a liquid layout. The later makes it easier to handle various browser window sizes, but make sure to set the min-width and max-width accordingly to ensure readability</li>
				<li>Viewports: relatively new measurement unit where 1vh = 1% of the browser height and 1vw = 1% of the browser width. Used this to create the welcome screen (provides the flexibility to adjust based on the browser window size)</li>
			</ul>
			<br/>	
			I think the next hurdle to climb would be getting a better grasp of JavaScript. I'll continue to document my progress on this page and see what kind of new features can be incorportated via Javascript. 
			<br/>
			<br/>
			<b>Changes:</b> 
			<ul class="entry">
				<li>Narrowed the upcoming column by a little bit, but kept the overall dimensions of the div close to the Golden ratio (just added a margin between the upcoming column and the entry one)</li>
			</ul>
			<b>Why?</b>
				<ul class="entry"> 
					<li>
						The previous layout was awkward with the amount of whitespace between the two columns, this one feels a bit better but like everything else on the page, it is subject to change
					</li>
				</ul>

				Day 7: Saying Goodbye to Logo v2
			</h3>
			<p class="date">Aug 26</p>
			<p class="entry">
				<b>Changes:</b> 
				<ul class="entry">
					<li>Removed the logo and header</li>
						<ul>
							<li>was able to implement the new welcome screen by making use of viewport units, specifically vw and vh</li>
							<li>the current implementation of getting the text to vertically center doesn't feel right. I created a div and set the display attribute to table-cell so that the vertical-align attribute would center the text (which is not its intended purpose). I'll keep it the way it is for now, but hopefully there is a better way</li>
						</ul>
					<li>Reworked the left column to be an upcoming/ to-do section </li>

				<b>Why?</b>
					<ul class="entry"> 
						<li>Trying out various kinds of layouts still, I think the page looks better without it</li>

			Day 1: Entry Structure

			Starting today, I'll update the changes of only the latest post. As more and more posts get added, it's going to look a little strange, but hopefully it conveys that the entries keep getting better.

			Aug 20

			<b>Changes:</b> 
			<ul>
				<li>Learned to use the list tag</li>
				<li>Used a horizontal rule to separate each entry</li> 
				<li>Updated change list to bold the sections</li>
				<li>Learned to use the img tag</li>

			<b>Why?</b>
			<ul> 
				<li>Needed a way to clearly separate the entries and for now, the hr tag gets the job done</li>
				<li>Bolding each section of the change log was done to make to make it easier to separate the 
					topic and the answer</li>
				<li>I want to put some images up to make the page look nicer</li>
				<li>Started with a text logo exported as a JPG for a v1</li>

			Goal: getting comfortable with HTML/CSS 
		</p>
		<p>	
			I'm going to try and improve this page whenever I learn more about HTML and CSS. I'll try keep a format going, lets say something like this:
		</p>
		<p>
			Date: Aug 19<br>
			Changes: Outlined the goals of this project<br> 
			Why were these changes made: Needed a tangible project to learn about HTML/CSS, started with the basics of the head, body, br and p tags<br>
		</p>

		<p>This is a work in progress.</p>
